	FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS about Parse::Plain


Q1. Why do you use %% and {{ }} as tag / block delimiters?
A1. These symbols are very rarely appear in pairs. More, unlike
HTML-style comments and HTML-style tags they are never hidden
by various WYSIWYG editors.


Q2. What if I must use these symbols elsewhere in my template?
A2. You can try this trick:
$t->set_tag('DPERC', '%%');
$t->set_tag('DCURLYL', '{{');
$t->set_tag('DCURLYR', '}}');

If your template is HTML the better idea is to use character entities:
&#037; for %
&#123; for {
&#125; for }

module was never tested with Perl 6!
