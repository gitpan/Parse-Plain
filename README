This package contains a simple template parsing engine. It allows to parse
text files as well as HTML, XML and other markup formats as they are
text files also.

This version 2.1 includes most of new features introduced in version 3.0 but
is 100% compatible with 2.0x. This is probably the last 2.x version released.

In order to install and use this package you will need Perl version
5.005 or better. Please note: the module hasn't been tested under
Perl 6!

To install:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
